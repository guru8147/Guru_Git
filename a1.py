"Success is not a Destination,It's a beautiful journey of a life."

"Our actions and Success should make noise not our voice."

"Interest makes men everything possible."

"Hardwork never goes in vain."


      To be successful in life u should come out of ur comfort zone and start 
      
      doing the hardwork for ur dream.Dream is not that thing where u will feel       
      something while u asleep,it is that thing which wont let you sleep, so
      
      please observe the difference man and move towards ur dream.Do u know y r
        

      u here for ?? First remember that thing ,I think u r forgetting that thing 
      
      that y r u r here.For ur present situation of ur life the one and only

      reason for that is "U" only because of ur laziness,fear,seriousness about

      ur dream and so on.You know already that u r the "Badshah of Badluck".

      After knowing this truth also if u dont do "Hardwork",just imagine where 

      ur life would be.You always used to tell me that u are passionate towards

      "Cinema",but did u ever do hardwork for that ? Ya I know u tried and you

      have done something ie theatre(only 2 plays) and attended auditions.

      But u did not get nothing from that y u know ? Because you were never 

      prepared for it and u never knew the weapon which is needed for there to        
      be settled or survive.Ok let it be what is happened already happened.

      Atleast u should have learnt lessons from ur past mistakes and take right 

      and good decision now atleast man.I know that you are a Emotion person 

      but that shoud not be a reason for ur failure.There is a saying that

      "Time heals everything".You know what I mean right ? Ok good.So now u dont 
       have too much time to achieve what u r dreaming for,So think,plan and           
       start doing ur hardwork and one more thing I want to tell you that 

       "Dedication" should be there and hereby I wish you "All the best".
